            <h2>My Life Pre-Covid</h2>
            <p>Before the pandemic I was a different person. Going into 2020 I was a musician working multiple jobs. I would be a bartender at a brewery for part of my day then go be a server at a high end restauraunt leaving my weekends to be a wedding DJ and make my own music. And on top of that making sure I spend time with my son. Once it was Covid season I was out of all my jobs and had to apply for unemployment which was delayed and a pain to even get. That's when I knew I needed a change.</p>

            <h2>Notable Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>Before I started learning Web Development and Eccomerce my main focus was on music. During this time I was able to accumulate over 2.5 million streams of my songs across all major platforms. On top of that I learned/used Influencer Marketing & Facebook Ads to sell out multiple shows. Once Covid came my focus turned to Eccomerce which I learned using only online courses and my previous experience. One of my first businesses took off and did over 18K in sales a little over its first month in business. I fell inlove with the Shopify platform and started to get into Web Development. I bought multiple courses and taught myself different languages which I then applied that knowledge to bussinesses I wanted to help.</p>

            <h2>Goals & Aspirations</h2>
            <p>Since learning how to navigate these different platforms and using different programming languages my goals have changed tenfold. In the next 3-5 years I would like to continue to grow as a programmer, developer, and designer by joining a company that is looking for a jack of all trades. Some more specific goals are to build a appointment app for shopify, a character generator using JS to cerate NFTs, build a twitter bot, and to build a webscraper thats sends data to a database for a web app.</p>
